The term tempera is derived from the Italian dipingere a tempera (\u201cpaint in distemper\u201d) from the Late Latin distemperare (\u201cmix thoroughly\u201d). You mix pigments with water and a binder.\nAlmost all pigments are suitable for egg tempera. This category lists all pigments suitable for egg tempera, gum tempera, and distemper or paint made with hide glue. Only alkali-resistant pigments, such as those suitable for fresco painting, are suitable for casein tempera, primarily when lime or other strong alkalies are used to make the casein binder, and the resulting casein solution is alkaline.",

Traditional paints include oils, tempera, watercolors, and gouache. In the past century, new paints were developed and adopted by professionals. These include acrylics and alkyds. More recently, encaustic and wax paints have received much attention from artists.\nThe quality of paint depends largely on the pigment and pigment concentration compared to the total volume of the paint. To determine the quality of paint, artists should understand the type of pigments used in paint and their relative lightfastness or degree by which they retain their color.\nThe biggest cost of paint is pigment.

Other drying oils have been used throughout its history, such as walnut, poppyseed, hemp, and, more recently, safflower oil. The viscosity of oil paint may be modified by thinning with a solvent such as turpentine or mineral spirit (white spirit). Oil paintings are often varnished to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film and to saturate colors. Adding oil or an alkyd medium can also modify the viscosity and drying time of oil paint. The thickness of the coat has considerable bearing on the time required for drying: thin coats of oil paint dry relatively quickly.\nOil paint is a traditional medium used by arti",

Canvas, wood, and paper are common painting supports, but the types of supports used for artwork are very extensive. Wooden panels, linen, and animal skins were among the first supports used for painting.\nMost discussions about painting supports focus on canvas, while others on rigid supports, primarily wooden panels. These two categories have been the traditional supports for hundreds of years. A growing trend is modern alternatives, such as composites.

Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint).\nA drawing instrument deposits a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. Drawing instruments include pencils, pens, sticks, brushes, and metal points. The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, have been used.\nSilverpoint and metalpoint drawing is one of the oldest methods of drawing.

Gilding methods include applying and gluing by hand, typically gold leaf or another metal leaf, or painting with gold flakes or particles, also called \u201cshell gold,\u201d onto a surface.\nGilding gives an object a gold appearance rather than using an actual solid gold object. In addition, gilding provides a solid, flat (two-dimensional) surface for artwork to contrast with the three-dimensional illusion of space developed in the painting.\nGilding with silver is called \u201cvermeil\u201d or \u201cgilt silver.\u201d The technique of gilding with silver is similar to applying gold leaf but does not require the same delicacy and skill as th",

This preparation links the support and the paint and is essential to the artwork's life. The type of paint chosen directly influences the choice of support, size, primer, or ground. This guide gives the artist an understanding of the materials best suited for particular applications.\nThe ground or primer is the layer used to prepare a support for painting. The color and tone of the ground can affect the color, and tonal values of the paint layers applied over it. The ground for flexible supports, such as stretched canvas, often differs from primers applied to rigid supports, such as wood panels.\nNote:\u00a0Use only the coated side of the panel for painting and m",

These are being replaced today by synthetic resins that remain flexible longer and are less prone to yellowing. These newer resins also do not require polar solvents, such as alcohol or acetone, to remove them, allowing removal from a painting surface without greatly affecting the paint layers below.\nVarnishes can be applied by brushing or spraying. The most common practice is to apply a picture varnish with a wide but thin, soft hair brush. For oil paintings, it is recommended to wait at least six months before applying a varnish. A similar although smaller waiting period is recommended for egg tempera paintings before varnishing. Acrylic paintings can be var",

Adding oil or an alkyd medium can also modify the viscosity and drying time of oil paint. The thickness of the coat has considerable bearing on the time required for drying: thin coats of oil paint dry relatively quickly.\nOil paint is a traditional medium used by arti",

The term tempera is derived from the Italian dipingere a tempera (\u201cpaint in distemper\u201d) from the Late Latin distemperare (\u201cmix thoroughly\u201d). You mix pigments with water and a binder.\nAlmost all pigments are suitable for egg tempera. This category lists all pigments suitable for egg tempera, gum tempera, and distemper or paint made with hide glue. Only alkali-resistant pigments, such as those suitable for fresco painting, are suitable for casein tempera, primarily when lime or other strong alkalies are used to make the casein binder, and the resulting casein solution is alkaline.",

Gilding methods include applying and gluing by hand, typically gold leaf or another metal leaf, or painting with gold flakes or particles, also called \u201cshell gold,\u201d onto a surface.\nGilding gives an object a gold appearance rather than using an actual solid gold object. In addition, gilding provides a solid, flat (two-dimensional) surface for artwork to contrast with the three-dimensional illusion of space developed in the painting.\nGilding with silver is called \u201cvermeil\u201d or \u201cgilt silver.\u201d The technique of gilding with silver is similar to applying gold leaf but does not require the same delicacy and skill as th",
